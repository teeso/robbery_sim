# Roberry simulation
##Introduction
Program Map.py is solving problem of setting police station in optimal place to catch robbers in city. Whole program is based on OSMnx library to work on OSM maps and street networks.
Program Heatmap is showing heatmap from starting place which shows how far robbers can escape in specified periods of time!

##Future
In future by adding weights to streets calculated by street density, street condition, traffic flow we could optimilize paths created by robbers and police cars, also our police station could by in most optimal place!
